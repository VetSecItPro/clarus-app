## What is Vajra?

Vajra is a YouTube transcript analysis tool that produces **structured, fact-checked summaries** in a specific format with:
- Quality scores (X/10)
- Plain-language explanations
- Inline fact-checking (✓ ⚠️ 🔴)
- "Worth your time?" verdicts
- Executive summaries

This is NOT a simple summary tool. It's a specialized analysis format designed to give users the 80/20 in plain language.

## When User Says: "Analyze YouTube video: [URL]" or "Summarize this video: [URL]"

**Follow this exact workflow:**

### Step 1: Extract Transcript
```bash
./analyze_youtube.sh "[VIDEO_URL]"
```

This creates files in `transcripts/`:
- `[VIDEO_ID]_raw.txt` - The transcript text
- `[VIDEO_ID]_structured.json` - With timestamps
- `[VIDEO_ID]_analysis_prompts.txt` - Helper file (ignore this)

### Step 2: Read VAJRA_PROMPT.md
**CRITICAL:** Before analyzing, read `VAJRA_PROMPT.md` in full. It contains:
- The complete output format template
- Quality score guidelines
- Plain-language writing rules
- Inline fact-check placement guidelines
- Executive summary format

### Step 3: Read the Transcript
Read the `[VIDEO_ID]_raw.txt` file that was just created.

### Step 4: Apply Vajra Format Analysis
Use the VAJRA_PROMPT.md guidelines to create a comprehensive analysis:

**All content includes:**
- TL;DR
- Quality Score with "Watch out for" warnings
- **Executive Summary** (200-500 words, scannable, for quick triage)
- Key Takeaways
- Should You Watch?
- What's Missing
- **Full Analysis** (detailed, plain-language, with inline fact-checks)

### Step 5: Save the Analysis
Save your Vajra analysis to:
```
transcripts/[VIDEO_ID]_vajra_analysis.md
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **DON'T:** Just summarize the video in your own format
✅ **DO:** Apply the full Vajra format from VAJRA_PROMPT.md

❌ **DON'T:** State facts as universal truths ("Graphene is 200x stronger...")
✅ **DO:** Frame as what the video says ("The video explains that graphene is 200x stronger...")

❌ **DON'T:** Add confirmatory AI notes (✓ "This is verified")
✅ **DO:** Only add warnings/cautions (⚠️ 🔴)

❌ **DON'T:** Skip the quality score
✅ **DO:** Always lead with quality score and "Watch out for" warnings

❌ **DON'T:** Skip the executive summary
✅ **DO:** Always include the executive summary for quick triage

## Example User Requests

**User says:**
> "Analyze YouTube video: https://youtu.be/abc123"

**You should:**
1. Run `./analyze_youtube.sh "https://youtu.be/abc123"`
2. Read `VAJRA_PROMPT.md` for format guidelines
3. Read the generated transcript file
4. Create Vajra-formatted analysis
5. Save to `transcripts/abc123_vajra_analysis.md`

---

**User says:**
> "Summarize this video: https://youtu.be/xyz789"

**You should:**
Same workflow! "Summarize" in this context means "do a Vajra analysis"

---

**User says:**
> "Can you expand the section on [topic]?"

**You should:**
1. Read the existing analysis file
2. Read relevant parts of transcript again
3. Expand that section with more detail (still following Vajra guidelines)
4. Update the analysis file

## Key Vajra Principles

### 1. Quality Score First
Users need to know immediately: "Is this worth my time?"
- Include "Best for" and "You'll learn"
- Focus on "Watch out for" warnings (NOT "why it's good")
- Give clear verdict

### 2. "The Video Says" Style
Frame content as describing what the video covers, not stating universal facts.

**Wrong:** "Graphene is 200x stronger than steel."
**Right:** "The video explains that graphene is 200x stronger than steel."

### 3. AI Commentary: Warnings Only
- ✓ **AI Note:** Very rare - only when verification adds unique value
- ⚠️ **AI Note:** Needs context, plausible but unverified, manufacturer claims
- 🔴 **Fact Check:** Wrong, misleading, or highly suspicious

**Never add confirmatory notes** like "This is well-documented" or "This is verified"

### 4. Plain Language Mandatory
Write as if explaining to someone who knows NOTHING about the topic.
- Define technical terms inline
- Use analogies
- Explain WHY things matter
- Don't assume background knowledge

### 5. Liberal Formatting
- **Bold** key terms, numbers, claims
- Bullets for lists
- Sub-headers within sections
- Create visual hierarchy
- Space things out

### 6. Executive Summary Always Included
For all content:
- Add 200-500 word executive summary BEFORE key takeaways
- Make it highly scannable with bullets
- Use section headers
- Enables 2-minute triage decision
- Full analysis placed at the END

### 7. Compress Meta, Expand Content
- **Compress** the meta-analysis (no fluff about "why it's good")
- **Expand** the content explanations (detailed, plain-language)
